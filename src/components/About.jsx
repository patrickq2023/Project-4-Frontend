      <h2>Welcome to exposure</h2>
      <p>
       This is a space created by photographers for photograhers to share images and to admire and appreciate other peoples work. It is intended
        to be more of a gallery to display beuatiful photographs rather than gain likes and followers. You wont get any stories or reels here, just classic 
        still photographs, no algorithms, and no comparisons ... This is intended to be a safe area that respects copyright of the authors of the images and 
        the people who took them. Feel free to comment on pictures and to show your appreciation, but please be respectful and kind, there is no room for negativity here ...
